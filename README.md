# CIS-351 Final Project

### Description
I created a data storage system for a mock DJ service as my final project for CIS-351 (Advanced Database Concepts).

The system is comprised of a database for day-to-day transactions and a data warehouse for long-term storage. It 
keeps track of all music, DJs, and venues.

For a detailed description, see the Administrator's Guide.
